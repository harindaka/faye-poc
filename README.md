# faye-poc
A POC done to understand Faye Server and Client behaviour

How to Run the project:

You will need to have NodeJS and Angular CLI installed globally. 
A Redis instance must be running on localhost:6379. This can be changed in server/src/config.js

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the server directory
3. Execute the command `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Execute the command `npm start` to run the server on port 3000
5. `cd` into the client-angular directory
6. Execute the command `npm install` to install dependencies
7. Execute the command `npm start` to start the server on port 4200.
